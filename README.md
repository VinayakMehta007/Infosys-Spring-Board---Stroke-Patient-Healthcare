# Stroke Prediction Using Linear Regression
## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the possibility of a stroke in patients based on various health parameters using a Linear Regression model. The dataset includes features such as age, gender, hypertension status, heart disease status, average glucose levels, BMI, and smoking status.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is

id: A unique identifier for each patient.

gender: Categorical feature that can be encoded as 0 = Female, 1 = Male.

age: Numerical feature representing the patient's age.

hypertension: Binary feature where 0 = no hypertension, 1 = hypertension.

heart_disease: Binary feature where 0 = no heart disease, 1 = heart disease.

ever_married: Categorical feature (Yes/No) indicating if the patient was ever married.

work_type: Categorical feature (Private, Govt_job, Self-employed, etc.).

Residence_type: Categorical feature where 0 = Rural, 1 = Urban.

avg_glucose_level: Numerical feature representing the average glucose level of the patient.

bmi: Numerical feature representing the patient's Body Mass Index (BMI).

smoking_status: Categorical feature (formerly smoked, never smoked, smokes).

stroke: Target variable where 0 = no stroke, 1 = stroke.
